			A bit more text could go here?
			<p>
			While trying to find a puzzle game with time travel 
			or time shifting as a main mechanic, we realized that there are not
			that many games in this genre. After narrowing
			our searching criteria to games which are also 3D and
			have a platformer aspect, because we wanted games that feel like a 
			combination of Portal and Super Mario, we had a hard time finding any.
			We ended up finding 9 games which fit our criteria.<footnote>Excludes: games that were made before 2000, non Windows games, shooter games (3), simulation games (1), real time strategy games (1)</footnote> Of those 9 games, 
			only 2 truly fit the criteria. Namely:	Quantum Conundrum and Project Temporality.
			</p>
			<p>
			So, we propose a game in which the player can not only control the main character,
			but (to some extent) also the world itself via the T.I.<footnote>Tachyonen-Insignifikator, see 'List of Abbreviations'</footnote>.
			This will allow the the player to time of his environment to different stages which
			differ not in the basic structure of the level but only in a few details like an opening
			in an otherwise solid wall, as well as in the textures.
			
			</p>
			<br>

		<h3 class="contentHeader">General Conditions and Constraints</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>
			The project which we are proposing does not have a large number of constraints.
			One of the main constraint is the deadline., which is in about 8 months.
			It has to be completed before the summer holidays.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of the 2 programming specific constraints is that we will use C#, 
			because all team members know this langage very well. 
			The other constraint is that we will be using the free and open source game engine Xenko, 
			because it will greatly speed up the development. 
			Unlike the alternatives, which include Unity, CryEngine, Mono UE and WaveEngine, 
			Xenko supports the latest C# features, has a great Visual Studio integration,
			supports debugging, is well documented and works cross-platform. 
			Cross-platform support is currently not planned, 
			however if the game is successful, 
			it will be a lot easier to make it run on non-Windows platforms. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lastly, the project will, most likely, be multilingual in order to appeal to a wider audience.

		<h3 class="contentHeader">Project Objectives and System Concepts</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
		<p><!--@Stefan I wrote #region all of this:-->
		The goal we are planning to achieve is a <!--good grade--> third-person 
		platform game with puzzle elements and some interesting new ideas and
		new combiniations of the latter, which doesn't exist in this way yet.
		</p>
		<p>
		The setting will vary between a range of geological and human-time-scaled epochs (i.e. textures, sounds, etc.)
		like primeval (dinosaur), medieval and modern times as well as different geographic places.
		</p>
		<p>
		Example for such a level:</br>
			The level starts right in front of a temple. The door is closed, so the player has too look if its open,
			when he goes to the past (where it may be still under construction) or the future (where some archeologist may already have opened it).
			After he overcomes this obstacle he can enter the temple, where he is confronted with various riddles and puzzles
			he has to solve in order to reach the end of the level. These could include rotating pipes to make a ball roll onto the correct switch,
			some logic-puzzles and even more use of the time-scrolling.
			If he, for example goes through a corridor, he might be killed (or pushed back, in child mode <!--@Stefan We could implement something like that, right?-->).
			But if he closely examines his surroundings, the is a note of one of the builders of the temple which says:
			"The grave chamber is almost finished. In two weeks, after burying the king, we will remove the mechanism to open it, so the traps will lead to inevitable death."
			This tells our hero that he has to go to the paste and use this mechanism to his advantage. This finally leads him to his goal.
		</p>
		<p>
		The multi-language support will include German, English and, with a huge maybe, Japanese.
