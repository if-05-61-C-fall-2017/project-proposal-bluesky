		<h3>Content</h3>

		<h3 class="contentHeader">Introduction</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			There are a vast number of video games with a great variety in style, gameplay, story and so on. But only a very small number of them focus on the great potential of time traveling.
			And, of these few, even fewer use it as a key feature of their gameplay. This is the point, where we come into play. Our idea is
			to make a game that provides a solution for the lack of games in this genre. This might not sound too exciting when you consider that
			the best selling games are mostly shooters and other games with great graphics and, even more important, a huge budget.
			However, this also means that the market is oversaturated. So, we decided to focus on a different group of people. 
			The casual gamers who do not play AAA shooters and are more into puzzle games.
			Also, this game is something that can be achieved realistically with our tools and knowledge, something that can be achieved with as few as two programmers and a time limit of less
			than a year. 
			It's obvious that this game won't be one to conquer the big Jump'n'Runs like Super Mario and claim their position, but rather an alternative
			to the latter.It will be a game which fills a market gap and uses rarely noticed concepts.
			</br>
			So, to conclude the statements above, we do not want to dipute the place of well-known and succesful developers, we want to contribute to the diversity and range of 
			video games and expand our horizon to things that haven't been thought before.
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">Initial Situation</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>
			While trying to find a puzzle game with time travel 
			or time shifting as a main mechanic, we realized that there are not
			that many games in this genre. After narrowing
			our searching criteria to games which are also 3D and
			have a platformer aspect, because we wanted games that feel like a 
			combination of Portal and Super Mario, we had a hard time finding any.
			We ended up finding 9 games which fit our criteria.<footnote>Excludes: games that were made before 2000, non Windows games, shooter games (3), simulation games (1), real time strategy games (1)</footnote> Of those 9 games, 
			only 2 truly fit the criteria. Namely:	Quantum Conundrum and Project Temporality.
			</p>
			<p>
			So, we propose a game in which the player can not only control the main character,
			but, to some extent, also the world itself via an in-game device. <footnote>Which will be called "Tachyonen-Insignifikator" in German</footnote>.
			This will allow the the player control the time of his environment,
			which is fairly similar to time travelling.
			
			</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">General Conditions and Constraints</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>
			The project which we are proposing does not have a large number of constraints.
			One of the main constraint is the deadline., which is in about 8 months.
			It has to be completed before the summer holidays.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of the 2 programming specific constraints is that we will use C#, 
			because all team members know this langage very well. 
			The other constraint is that we will be using the free and open source game engine Xenko, 
			because it will greatly speed up the development. 
			Unlike the alternatives, which include Unity, CryEngine, Mono UE and WaveEngine, 
			Xenko supports the latest C# features, has a great Visual Studio integration,
			supports debugging, is well documented and works cross-platform. 
			Cross-platform support is currently not planned, 
			however if the game is successful, 
			it will be a lot easier to make it run on non-Windows platforms. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lastly, the project will, most likely, be multilingual in order to appeal to a wider audience.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">Project Objectives and System Concepts</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
		<p>
		The goal, which we are planning to achieve, is creating a third-person 
		platformer game with puzzle elements and some creative new ideas 
		and combining it in ways which have never been done before.
		</p>
		<p>
		The setting will vary between a range of geological and human-time-scaled epochs
		such as primeval <footnote>Dinosaurs!</footnote>, medieval and modern times as well as different geographic locations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Example for such a level:</br>
			The level starts right in front of a temple. 
			The entrance door is closed, so the player has to check if its open in another epoch.
			For example, when he goes to the past, it may be still under construction
			or some archeologist may have opened it in the future.
			<br>
			After he overcomes this obstacle he can enter the temple, 
			where he is confronted with various riddles and puzzles
			which he has to solve in order to reach the end of the level.
			These could include rotating pipes to make a ball roll onto the correct switch,
			some logic-puzzles and a lot of puzzles where you have to make use of your time-scrolling ability.
			<br>
			If he, for example, goes through a corridor, he might be killed or pushed back.
			But, after he closely examines his surroundings, the player will notice that there is a note written by of one of the builders of the temple.
			It says,	"The grave chamber is almost finished. In 14 sunrises, after burying the holy king, we shall activate the traps which lead to inevitable death."
			This tells our hero that he has to go to the past where the traps have not yet been activated. This finally leads him to his goal.
		</p>
		<p>
		The multi-language support will include German, English and, with a huge maybe, Japanese.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">Opportunities and Risks</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
		<p>
		The game is worth investing in, because it offers great potential opportunities while keeping the risks fairly small.
		It does so by keeping the budget fairly low. All of the software which will be used is free, modern and open source software.
		The developers themselves offer a fair and competitive price for the game development.
		<p>
		Since the game is in a large but mostly ignored market niche, the number of potential customers is high.
		Also, because there are very few compareable games, it means that the game can be sold for a rather high price.
		It is also possible that the market niche is smaller than expected.
		Another aspect which can lead to the game being a commercial success, is the fact that it combines
		parts of highly succesful game genres. Namely, platformers and puzzle games.
		It may be possible that these genres are out of fashion. However, this is very unlikely because there are a lot of very recent games in the 
			<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/Platformer/#p=0&tab=PopularNewReleases">platformer</a> 
			and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/tag/en/Puzzle/#p=0&tab=PopularNewReleases">puzzle</a>
			genres on steam.
		Some other potential risks are that the proposed project fails because 2 progammers are not enough 
		or because the tools turn out to be inadequate.
