		<h3 class="contentHeader">Initial Situation</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>
			While trying to find a puzzle game with time travel 
			or time shifting as a main mechanic, we realized that there are not
			that many games in this genre. After narrowing
			our searching criteria to games which are also 3D and
			have a platformer aspect, because we wanted games that feel like a 
			combination of Portal and Super Mario, we had a hard time finding any.
			We ended up finding 9 games which fit our criteria.<footnote>Excludes: games that were made before 2000, non Windows games, shooter games (3), simulation games (1), real time strategy games (1)</footnote> Of those 9 games, 
			only 2 truly fit the criteria. Namely:	Quantum Conundrum and Project Temporality.
			</p>
			<p>
			So, we propose a game in which the player can not only control the main character,
			but,to some extent, also the world itself via an in-game device. <footnote>Which will be called "Tachyonen-Insignifikator"</footnote>.
			This will allow the the player control the time of his environment,
			which is fairly similar to time travelling.
			
			</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">General Conditions and Constraints</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
			<p>
			The project which we are proposing does not have a large number of constraints.
			One of the main constraint is the deadline., which is in about 8 months.
			It has to be completed before the summer holidays.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of the 2 programming specific constraints is that we will use C#, 
			because all team members know this langage very well. 
			The other constraint is that we will be using the free and open source game engine Xenko, 
			because it will greatly speed up the development. 
			Unlike the alternatives, which include Unity, CryEngine, Mono UE and WaveEngine, 
			Xenko supports the latest C# features, has a great Visual Studio integration,
			supports debugging, is well documented and works cross-platform. 
			Cross-platform support is currently not planned, 
			however if the game is successful, 
			it will be a lot easier to make it run on non-Windows platforms. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lastly, the project will, most likely, be multilingual in order to appeal to a wider audience.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3 class="contentHeader">Project Objectives and System Concepts</h3>
		<div class="contentText">
		<p>
		The goal, which we are planning to achieve, is creating a third-person 
		platformer game with puzzle elements and some creative new ideas 
		and combining it in ways which have never been done before.
		</p>
		<p>
		The setting will vary between a range of geological and human-time-scaled epochs
		such as primeval <footnote>Dinosaurs!</footnote>, medieval and modern times as well as different geographic locations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Example for such a level:</br>
			The level starts right in front of a temple. 
			The entrance door is closed, so the player has to check if its open in another epoch.
			For example, when he goes to the past, it may be still under construction
			or some archeologist may have opened it in the future.
			<br>
			After he overcomes this obstacle he can enter the temple, 
			where he is confronted with various riddles and puzzles
			which he has to solve in order to reach the end of the level.
			These could include rotating pipes to make a ball roll onto the correct switch,
			some logic-puzzles and a lot of puzzles where you have to make use of your time-scrolling ability.
			<br>
			If he, for example, goes through a corridor, he might be killed or pushed back.
			But, after he closely examines his surroundings, the player will notice that there is a note written by of one of the builders of the temple.
			It says,	"The grave chamber is almost finished. In 14 sunrises, after burying the holy king, we shall activate the traps which lead to inevitable death."
			This tells our hero that he has to go to the past where the traps have not yet been activated. This finally leads him to his goal.
		</p>
		<p>
		The multi-language support will include German, English and, with a huge maybe, Japanese.
